    Life is not a straight line... it's a winding path filled with unexpected turns, quiet pauses, and sudden storms. <break time="300ms"/> 
    We chase dreams through cities of noise, yet often find truth in moments of stillness. <break time="200ms"/> 
    Each heartbeat carries a story â€” of survival, love, failure, and resilience. <break time="500ms"/> 
    In a world that demands speed, the greatest act of courage... may simply be to slow down. 
    <emphasis level="moderate">To listen. To breathe. To be.</emphasis>
